# IR-Safety-Vision-Prototype-v1.0
This repository contains a Python-based computer vision prototype designed to solve the problem of "alert fatigue" in industrial environments. By combining spatial zone mapping with Near-Infrared (NIR) signal simulation, the system provides a context-aware safety layer that only triggers alerts when unequipped personnel enter high-risk areas.
